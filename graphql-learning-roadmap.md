## Introduction to GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. It provides:

- A complete and understandable description of the data in your API
- Gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need
- Enables powerful developer tools for exploring and testing APIs
- Strong type system that defines the capabilities of an API

### Core Concepts

1. **Schema**: Defines the types and relationships in your API
2. **Queries**: Allow clients to request specific data
3. **Mutations**: Allow clients to modify data
4. **Resolvers**: Functions that fetch data for each field in a query or mutation
5. **Types**: Define the shape of your data including scalars (String, Int, Boolean, ID, Float) and custom object types
6. **Subscriptions**: Enable real-time data updates

## Key Differences Between REST and GraphQL

| Aspect | REST | GraphQL |
|--------|------|---------|
| Endpoints | Multiple endpoints (/users, /posts, /comments) | Single endpoint |
| Data Structure | Fixed data structures | Clients request exactly what they need |
| Related Resources | Multiple requests needed | Everything fetched in one request |
| HTTP Methods | Uses GET, POST, PUT, DELETE | Primarily uses POST |
| Data Issues | Over-fetching/under-fetching | Precise data selection |
